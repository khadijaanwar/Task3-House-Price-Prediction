# Task 3 — Multimodal Housing Price Prediction (Images + Tabular Data)

## 🎯 Objective
Predict housing prices using a combination of **structured tabular features** and **house images**.

## 🛠️ Methodology / Approach
- Preprocessed tabular data (numerical + categorical).  
- Used **CNNs** (Convolutional Neural Networks) to extract image features.  
- Combined image features with tabular embeddings for multimodal learning.  
- Trained regression models on the fused features.  
- Evaluated results using **MAE** and **RMSE**.  

## 📊 Key Results / Observations
- Multimodal model outperformed single-modality baselines.  
- CNN extracted meaningful representations from property images.  
- Feature fusion improved prediction stability and reduced error rates.
